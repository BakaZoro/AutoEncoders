# AutoEncoders
AutoEncoders are a type of generative model. This repository shall have implementations of the different types of AutoEncoders.

1. Vannila Autoencoder: The most simple autoencoder. Where the images go through an encoder model and then the decoder model to generate back the image. This implementation uses only Dense layers and hence is the most basic implementation. But this helps with proper visualisation. The Encoder, Decoder and the complete AutoEncoder model have been implemented.
