# AutoEncoders
AutoEncoders are a type of generative model. This repository shall have implementations of the different types of AutoEncoders.

1. Vannila Autoencoder: The most simple autoencoder. Where the images go through an encoder model and then the decoder model to generate back the image. This implementation uses only Dense layers and hence is the most basic implementation and extracts 2 latent features. The Encoder, Decoder and the complete AutoEncoder model have been implemented. 

2. Convolution Autoencoder: A simple autoencoder implemented using CNN. The images go through an encoder model and then the decoder model to generate back the image. This generates better images than Vanilla Autoencoder because we have extracted 10 latent features and also used CNN along with Dense layers.
